            <p><strong>Project 1</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>GangWars RP</strong></em></p><br>
            <p>This is a custom server I have made with the help of another developer/friend of mine and the community of ours. We manage to provide a game server for fiveM and keep it up to date with in game updates and software updates in the backend as well. GangWars RP has been in development for 2+ years and will continue to be a project of mine until the interest goes away. In the development field this has helped me get an idea of reading code, what proper code should look like, and learn some elements before I started to learn myself, I guess  you could say it was the inspiration I chose to go down this path.</p>

            <p>Project 2</p>
            <p><em><strong>RaidingMC</strong></em></p><br>
            <p>RaidingMC was a project of mine I had started back in my teenage years, I purchased a minecraft server off of someone with no knowledge and made it mine. This came with alot of problems and had helped me learn how to create and become efficient in minecraft server making. The most important part about me starting this when I was younger was introducing me to servers and code and computer stuff in general. I feel without doing this as a kid this path would have never been possible for me and I would have 0 knowledge of what I have now server wise(dedicated servers / SQL / SSH etc).</p>

            <p>Project 3</p>
            <p><em><strong>Freelance Work</strong></em></p><br>
            <p>With the start of my Full Stack Development courses I have decided to take on freelance work, this is starting with self projects like this and will end up widening to hopefully someone whos reading this or anyone I come across that is in the need of something being created in my field. Now I know I would not be anywhere near professional since I am a beginner and learning so my pricing will reflect that but as the time comes and my work becomes better the pricing will increase but that does not matter. <span class="space"></span><p>I plan to provide services along the lines of:</p><br><ul><li>Web Development</li><li>JS/ReactJS/TS</li><li>FiveM Scripting</li></ul></p>
